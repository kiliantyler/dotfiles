# Project Brief: Dotfiles Repository

## Project Overview

This repository contains dotfiles for system configuration, application settings, and environment customization. The goal is to maintain a consistent, version-controlled, and easily deployable set of configurations across different machines and environments.

## Purpose

To create a seamless, reproducible development and user experience across multiple systems by automating the setup and maintenance of personal configurations and preferences.

## Core Requirements

### Functionality

* Maintain configuration files for shell environments, editors, CLI tools, and other applications
* Support cross-platform compatibility where applicable (macOS, Linux, possibly Windows)
* Enable easy setup of a new machine with personal preferences
* Provide mechanisms for keeping configurations in sync across systems
* Implement sensible defaults while allowing for machine-specific customizations

### Technical Requirements

* Use chezmoi for dotfile management and deployment
* Maintain a clean, well-organized structure that is easy to navigate and update
* Include documentation for manual steps that cannot be automated
* Ensure sensitive information is properly secured and not committed to the repository
* Support idempotent installation/updates (can run multiple times without adverse effects)

### Quality Attributes

* Maintainability: Easy to update and extend
* Portability: Works across different environments
* Security: Protects sensitive information
* Reliability: Consistent behavior across systems
* Simplicity: Clear structure and minimal complexity

## Project Scope

### In Scope

* Shell configurations (fish, bash, zsh, etc.)
* Editor configurations (VSCode, Vim, etc.)
* Terminal settings and customizations
* Git and version control configurations
* CLI tool configurations and customizations
* Application-specific settings where applicable
* Installation/bootstrap scripts
* Documentation for manual configurations

### Out of Scope

* System-level configurations that require admin privileges (unless specifically needed)
* Hardware-specific configurations
* Extremely personalized settings that wouldn't be useful across systems
* Large binary files or applications (focus on configurations, not software installation)

## Success Criteria

* Successfully deploy all configurations to a new system with minimal manual intervention
* Maintain consistency across different systems
* Enable quick updates and synchronization of changes
* Provide a reliable system for managing personal computing environment

## Dependencies

* chezmoi for dotfile management
* Git for version control
* Shell environments (fish, bash, zsh) depending on configuration
* Various applications and tools being configured

## Constraints

* Must work with the limitations of each supported platform
* Must respect application-specific configuration requirements
* Must handle sensitive information securely
