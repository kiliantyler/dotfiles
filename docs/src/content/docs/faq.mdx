## What is this?

This is my collection of dotfiles. It's a set of configuration files that I use to customize my system.

## What are "dotfiles"?

Dotfiles are configuration files that are used to customize and personalize your system.
They are called "dotfiles" because they are typically hidden files that start with a dot
(e.g. `.bashrc`, `.gitconfig`, `.aws/`).

## Why should I care?

Dotfiles are a great way to customize your system and make it your own.
They can help you be more productive and efficient by automating repetitive tasks and
setting up your environment the way you like it.

## Why are your dotfiles special?

They aren't. They're just mine. But I've spent a lot of time on them and I think they're pretty cool.
I've tried to make them as simple and easy to use as possible, while still being powerful and flexible.
