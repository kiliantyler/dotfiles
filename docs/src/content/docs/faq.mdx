## Dotfiles Basics

### What is this repository?

This is my personal collection of dotfiles - configuration files that customize my development environment across different systems. It includes shell configurations, application preferences, keyboard shortcuts, and automation scripts that I've refined over years of use.

### What are "dotfiles"?

Dotfiles are configuration files that customize applications and system behaviors on Unix-like operating systems (Linux, macOS, BSD). They're called "dotfiles" because they traditionally begin with a dot (`.`), making them hidden files in directory listings.

Examples include:

- `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` - Shell configuration
- `.gitconfig` - Git user settings and aliases
- `.vimrc` - Vim editor preferences
- `.tmux.conf` - Tmux terminal multiplexer settings
- `.config/` - Directory containing many modern app configs

### Why should I care about dotfiles?

Investing time in your dotfiles offers significant benefits:

- **Consistency** - Maintain identical environments across multiple machines
- **Efficiency** - Automate repetitive tasks and streamline workflows
- **Personalization** - Customize tools to match your preferences and habits
- **Portability** - Quickly set up a familiar environment on new systems
- **Version control** - Track changes and experiment with configurations safely
- **Knowledge** - Learn more about how your tools actually work

For developers especially, well-crafted dotfiles can dramatically improve productivity by reducing friction in daily workflows.

### Why are your dotfiles special?

They aren't inherently special - they're just mine. I've spent years refining them to match my specific workflow and preferences. What might be unique about my approach is:

1. The comprehensive documentation (this wiki)
2. The true one-command installation system
3. The modular organization using Chezmoi
4. My focus on cross-platform compatibility
5. The balance between power and simplicity I've aimed for

I don't claim they're better than anyone else's - they're simply optimized for me.

## Installation & Management

### How do I use these dotfiles?

You have several options:

1. **Browse for inspiration** - Look through the code and documentation to find ideas for your own dotfiles
2. **Cherry-pick specific configs** - Copy parts you like into your own setup
3. **Fork the repository** - Create your own version to customize
4. **Install directly** - Use the [installation guide](/installation) (though read the warnings first)

For most people, the first two options are recommended.

### What makes your installation process different?

My installation is genuinely a single command that handles everything:

```shell
curl install.dotfiles.wiki/kiliantyler | sh
```

Unlike many other "one-liner" dotfiles installers, mine:

- Requires no manual prerequisites
- Installs all necessary dependencies
- Works across different operating systems
- Needs no preparation or configuration before running

### How do you manage your dotfiles?

I use [Chezmoi](/management-tools/chezmoi), a dotfiles manager that offers:

- Templating for machine-specific configurations
- Secure handling of secrets
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Easy synchronization between machines
- Powerful scripting capabilities

Chezmoi maintains my dotfiles in a central repository while deploying them correctly to each system.

## Technical Questions

### What tools do you use?

You can see a comprehensive listing of all the tools I use in the [tools](/management-tools) section. Some highlights include:

- Shell: Fish with Starship prompt
- Terminal: Ghostty (macOS) and Windows Terminal (Windows/WSL2)
- Editor: VSCode
- Package Managers: Mise, Homebrew, Scoop

### How often do you update your dotfiles?

I continuously refine my dotfiles as my workflow evolves. Major updates typically occur when:

- I discover new tools that improve my workflow
- I encounter pain points in my current setup
- I learn better ways of doing things

The Git history shows the evolution over time.

## Common Concerns

### Are dotfiles secure?

Dotfiles themselves are just configuration files, but they can contain sensitive information like:

- API tokens
- Private server addresses
- Personal preferences
- Authentication credentials

My dotfiles management strategy uses [Chezmoi's encryption](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/encryption/age/) for initial setup, as well as [1Password](http://1password.com/) for managing secrets.

### Will these slow down my system?

Poorly implemented dotfiles can impact system performance. I've optimized mine to:

- Lazy-load functionality only when needed
- Avoid unnecessary processes and background tasks
- Cache results of expensive operations
- Use efficient scripting practices

If you notice performance issues, check the [troubleshooting](/troubleshooting) section.

### How do I back up my existing configuration before trying these?

Before installing any dotfiles, it's wise to back up your existing configuration:

```shell
mkdir ~/dotfiles-backup
cp -r ~/.bash* ~/.zsh* ~/.git* ~/.vim* ~/dotfiles-backup/
```

Chezmoi will also create backups of files it replaces during installation.

### Should I just copy all your settings?

Probably not. Dotfiles are highly personal and reflect years of individual workflow optimization. Instead:

1. Start with minimal configurations
2. Add customizations incrementally as you understand them
3. Document why you made each change
4. Regularly review and remove unused configurations

Your ideal environment will be unique to how you work.

## Best Practices

### What's the best way to organize dotfiles?

While there's no single "right way," some effective approaches include:

- **Topic-based organization** - Group by tool or function (shell, git, editor)
- **Modularity** - Break configurations into smaller, focused files
- **Documentation** - Comment extensively on non-obvious settings
- **Version control** - Always keep dotfiles in a Git repository
- **Automation** - Use installation/bootstrap scripts
- **Separation of concerns** - Keep machine-specific settings separate from general ones

My repository demonstrates these principles in action.

### How did you learn all of this?

My dotfiles knowledge came from:

- Years of incremental improvements
- Studying other people's dotfiles repositories
- Active participation in developer communities
- Reading documentation for tools I use
- Trial and error (lots of error!)

The best way to learn is to start simple and gradually expand your configurations as you understand more.

### Where can I find more resources about dotfiles?

Some excellent dotfiles resources include:

- [GitHub's dotfiles page](https://dotfiles.github.io/)
- [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) for inspiration
- [Awesome Dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles)
- Individual tool documentation
- Other developers' dotfiles repositories

I also recommend joining communities where people share and discuss their configurations.

### Why did you make Dottie?

Because she's cute.
