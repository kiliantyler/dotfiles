## Why you shouldn't install my dotfiles

Dotfiles are deeply personal configurations that reflect years of individual workflow optimization, personal preferences, and specific hardware/software setups. Here's why you should think twice before installing mine:

- **They're built for my workflow**: My configurations are optimized for how _I_ work, not necessarily how you work
- **System-specific optimizations**: These dotfiles may include configurations specific to my hardware, OS version, and installed software
- **Breaking changes**: What works perfectly on my system might break functionality on yours
- **Security considerations**: Installing dotfiles means running code written by someone else that can access sensitive parts of your system
- **Learning opportunity missed**: Building your own dotfiles from scratch teaches you valuable skills about your system
- **Maintenance challenges**: When issues arise, you'll need to understand someone else's configuration structure to fix them
- **Personal preferences**: Color schemes, key bindings, and UI choices are highly subjective and may not match your taste
- **Dependency assumptions**: My dotfiles may assume the presence of specific tools, fonts, or utilities you don't use

Instead of installing these directly, consider:

- Using them as reference/inspiration for your own dotfiles
- Cherry-picking specific configurations you understand and need
- Forking the repository and gradually adapting it to your needs

## If you insist

<Aside type="danger" title="Important Warning">
Installing someone else's dotfiles is risky and not recommended unless you fully understand the implications. Proceed with caution!
There will be no support for issues arising from installing these dotfiles.
</Aside>

If you've read the warnings above and still want to proceed, here's how to install my dotfiles.

### Quick Installation

One simple command to install everything:

```shell
curl install.dotfiles.wiki/kiliantyler | sh
```
<Aside type="tip" title="Customization">
The installation script is hosted on [Cloudflare Workers](/management-tools/cloudflare) and supports installing other users' dotfiles by changing the username:

```shell
curl install.dotfiles.wiki/username | sh
```
</Aside>

### What happens during installation

The installation process:
<Steps>
1. Downloads the `install.sh` script from the [repository](/repolayout/#file-structure)

2. Installs all required dependencies for your system

3. Sets up [Chezmoi](/management-tools/chezmoi) as the dotfiles manager

4. Applies all configurations automatically
</Steps>

### Installation Philosophy

I believe in true "one-liner" installation experiences:

- **Truly one command** - No manual preparation or prerequisites needed
- **Complete automation** - Handles all dependency installation and configuration
- **Cross-platform** - Works across different operating systems
- **Reproducible** - Delivers consistent results every time
- **No manual steps** - No need to edit files or run additional commands after installation
- **User-friendly** - Designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible

<Aside type="tip" title="Why this is different">
Many "one-liner" dotfiles installers actually require pre-installation setup or multiple commands. This solution aims to be a genuine one-command experience that handles everything for you.
