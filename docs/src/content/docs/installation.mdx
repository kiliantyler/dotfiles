### Installation Script

There is an `install.sh` script in the root of the [repository](/tools/chezmoi/repo/#file-structure) that will allow
the install of required tools and then run the dotfiles scripts via [Chezmoi](/tools/chezmoi/overview).

:::tip
The script is hosted on a [Cloudflare](/external/cloudflare/overview) workers and you can pass in a username to the
curl command to install a specific user's dotfiles.
:::

```shell
curl install.dotfiles.wiki/kiliantyler | sh
```

### Ideals

The script is designed to be as simple as possible and to be as easy to use as possible. It is designed to be a
one-liner that can be run on any system to install the dotfiles.

There are many other "one-click" or "one-liner" dotfiles install scripts out there, but they generally are not truly
"one-liners" as they require some manual setup or configuration before the "one-line" can be run. This script is
designed to be a true one-liner. Installing all the required tools and then running the dotfiles install.

If you have to install any tools or configure anything before running a "one-liner" then it is not a true "one-liner",
in my opinion.
