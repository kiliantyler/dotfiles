## Why you shouldn't install my dotfiles

Dotfiles are deeply personal configurations that reflect years of individual workflow optimization, personal preferences, and specific hardware/software setups. Here's why you should think twice before installing mine:

- **They're built for my workflow**: My configurations are optimized for how _I_ work, not necessarily how you work
- **System-specific optimizations**: These dotfiles may include configurations specific to my hardware, OS version, and installed software
- **Breaking changes**: What works perfectly on my system might break functionality on yours
- **Security considerations**: Installing dotfiles means running code written by someone else that can access sensitive parts of your system
- **Learning opportunity missed**: Building your own dotfiles from scratch teaches you valuable skills about your system
- **Maintenance challenges**: When issues arise, you'll need to understand someone else's configuration structure to fix them
- **Personal preferences**: Color schemes, key bindings, and UI choices are highly subjective and may not match your taste
- **Dependency assumptions**: My dotfiles may assume the presence of specific tools, fonts, or utilities you don't use

Instead of installing these directly, consider:

- Using them as reference/inspiration for your own dotfiles
- Cherry-picking specific configurations you understand and need
- Forking the repository and gradually adapting it to your needs

## If you insist

<Aside type="danger" title="Important Warning">
Installing someone else's dotfiles is risky and not recommended unless you fully understand the implications. Proceed with caution!
There will be no support for issues arising from installing these dotfiles.
</Aside>

If you've read the warnings above and still want to proceed, here's how to install my dotfiles.

### Quick Installation

Choose the installation command for your operating system:

#### Unix-like systems (macOS, Linux)

```shell
curl -fsSL https://install.dotfiles.wiki/ | sh
```

#### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
iex "&{$(irm 'https://install.dotfiles.wiki/?os=windows')}"
```

### Customization Options

The installation script is hosted on [Cloudflare Workers](/management-tools/cloudflare) and supports several customization options through URL parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `username` | Git username | kiliantyler |
| `provider` | Git provider (github, gitlab, bitbucket, or any custom domain) | github |
| `branch` | Repository branch | main |
| `repo` | Repository name | dotfiles |
| `os` | Operating system (windows, macos, linux) | auto-detect |

#### Examples

Install dotfiles from a GitLab user on the develop branch:

```shell
curl -fsSL 'https://install.dotfiles.wiki/?username=johndoe&provider=gitlab&branch=develop' | sh
```

Install dotfiles from a custom repository name:

```shell
curl -fsSL 'https://install.dotfiles.wiki/?username=johndoe&repo=my-config' | sh
```

Install Windows dotfiles from Bitbucket:

```powershell
iex "&{$(irm 'https://install.dotfiles.wiki/?username=janedoe&provider=bitbucket&os=windows')}"
```

### What happens during installation

The installation process:
<Steps>
1. The Cloudflare Worker generates a customized script based on your operating system and parameters

2. Installs any prerequisites (e.g. Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS)

3. Downloads and installs [Chezmoi](/management-tools/chezmoi) as the dotfiles manager

4. Initializes Chezmoi with your specified Git repository
</Steps>

<Aside type="note" title="Script security">
The installation scripts are generated dynamically and sanitized to prevent injection attacks and other security issues. The source code is available in the repository under the `cloudflare` directory.
</Aside>

### Installation Philosophy

I believe in true "one-liner" installation experiences:

- **Truly one command** - No manual preparation or prerequisites needed
- **Complete automation** - Handles all dependency installation and configuration
- **Cross-platform** - Works across different operating systems
- **Reproducible** - Delivers consistent results every time
- **No manual steps** - No need to edit files or run additional commands after installation
- **User-friendly** - Designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible

<Aside type="tip" title="Why this is different">
Many "one-liner" dotfiles installers actually require pre-installation setup or multiple commands. This solution aims to be a genuine one-command experience that handles everything for you.
</Aside>
