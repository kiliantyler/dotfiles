# Age

[Age](https://age-encryption.org/) is a simple, modern, and secure file encryption tool. It's designed to be a simpler alternative to tools like GPG, focusing specifically on file encryption.

## Configuration Files

- `.chezmoiscripts/runOnce/run_once_before_0-decrypt_age_key.sh.tmpl` - Script template to decrypt Age keys during Chezmoi initialization
- `.chezmoiscripts/runOnce/run_once_before_0-decrypt_age_key.ps1.tmpl` - PowerShell equivalent for Windows systems

These files both create a decrypted Age key which is then used for decrypting other secrets in the Chezmoi configuration.
