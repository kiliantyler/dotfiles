Managing dotfiles across macOS, Linux, and Windows takes more than a Git repo and some symlinks. I use a set of specialized tools that each handle a specific piece of the puzzle.

## How It All Fits Together

[Chezmoi](/management-tools/chezmoi) is the orchestrator — it manages the dotfiles, renders templates per platform, and runs lifecycle scripts. [Age](/management-tools/age) encrypts secrets so they can live safely in a public repo. [1Password](https://1password.com/) provides runtime secrets (API keys, SSH signing keys) that get injected into templates at apply time.

On macOS, [Ansible](/management-tools/ansible) handles system-level setup that chezmoi can't do alone — Dock layout, Finder preferences, trackpad settings, and Homebrew package installation. On Windows, PowerShell scripts in `.chezmoiscripts/` handle the equivalent work.

[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) manages CLI tool versions across all platforms — over 50 tools from a single `config.toml`. Platform-specific package managers fill in the gaps where mise can't reach.

The [Cloudflare Worker](/management-tools/cloudflare) ties it all together with a one-command installation URL that detects your OS and bootstraps everything.

## Package Management by Platform

Different platforms need different package managers. Here's what handles what:

| Platform | Manager | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| All | [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) | CLI tools (55+ tools: node, python, go, kubectl, terraform, etc.) |
| macOS | [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) | System packages + GUI apps (via Ansible) |
| Windows | [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) | CLI tools not available in mise (eza, topgrade, bat, etc.) |
| Windows | [Winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/) | GUI applications (VS Code, Discord, Docker, etc.) |
| Windows | [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) | Legacy — just nvidia-app |

## Automation

[Task](https://taskfile.dev/) is the general-purpose task runner, with definitions for Ansible, docs, and gitattributes management. The [Cloudflare Worker](/management-tools/cloudflare) handles the installation URL. GitHub Actions deploys both the docs and the worker.
