## Welcome to My Dotfiles

If you've seen one dotfiles repo you've seen them all. They're all the same. They're all a mess.

This one is no different. But it's mine.

### What is this repository?

This is my personal collection of dotfiles - the configuration files that customize my development environment, tools, and workflow. While primarily created for my own use, I've documented everything here to:

1. Help me remember what I did and why
2. Share what I've learned with others
3. Create a reference for anyone interested in dotfiles management

### More than just dotfiles

This repository is also a growing knowledge base for dotfiles management. I'm attempting to turn it into a general-purpose Dotfiles Wiki that documents:

- Best practices for organizing dotfiles
- Tools and techniques for dotfiles management
- Common patterns and solutions for configuration challenges
- My personal journey of customization and optimization

### Key features

- [Chezmoi](/management-tools/chezmoi) for dotfiles management
- True [one-command installation](/installation#quick-installation)
- Cross-platform support
- Extensive documentation
- Modular organization

### Philosophy

My approach to dotfiles centers on a few core principles:

- **Automation**: If it can be automated, it should be
- **Documentation**: Everything should be well-documented (for future me)
- **Modularity**: Components should be organized and separable
- **Transparency**: The how and why behind each configuration choice

### Getting started

Curious about what's here? You can:

- Browse the docs to learn about my setup
- Check out the [installation guide](/installation) (but read the warnings first!)
- Explore specific tools and configurations in the sidebar

Remember: These are _my_ dotfiles. They work for _me_. Your needs will be different. Use this as inspiration, not as a template to blindly apply to your system.
