## Welcome to My Dotfiles

If you've seen one dotfiles repo you've seen them all. They're all the same. They're all a mess.

This one is no different. But it's mine.

## Meet Dottie

Say hello to Dottie, the friendly mascot of this dotfiles repository! Dottie represents the spirit of my dotfiles project: helpful, adaptable, and a bit quirky. She's here to guide you through the sometimes complex world of configuration files and system customization.

As the face of this project, Dottie reminds us that dotfiles aren't just about codeâ€”they're about creating an environment that feels like home wherever you log in. Look for her throughout the documentation where she'll provide helpful tips and insights.

### What is this repository?

This is my personal collection of dotfiles - the configuration files that customize my development environment, tools, and workflow. While primarily created for my own use, I've documented everything here to:

1. Help me remember what I did and why
2. Share what I've learned with others
3. Create a reference for anyone interested in dotfiles management

### More than just dotfiles

This repository is also a growing knowledge base for dotfiles management. I'm attempting to turn it into a general-purpose Dotfiles Wiki that documents:

- Best practices for organizing dotfiles
- Tools and techniques for dotfiles management
- Common patterns and solutions for configuration challenges
- My personal journey of customization and optimization

### Key features

- [Chezmoi](/management-tools/chezmoi) for dotfiles management
- True [one-command installation](/installation#quick-installation)
- Cross-platform support
- Extensive documentation
- Modular organization

### Philosophy

My approach to dotfiles centers on a few core principles:

- **Automation**: If it can be automated, it should be
- **Documentation**: Everything should be well-documented (for future me)
- **Modularity**: Components should be organized and separable
- **Transparency**: The how and why behind each configuration choice

### Getting started

Curious about what's here? You can:

- Browse the docs to learn about my setup
- Check out the [installation guide](/installation) (but read the warnings first!)
- Explore specific tools and configurations in the sidebar

Remember: These are _my_ dotfiles. They work for _me_. Your needs will be different. Use this as inspiration, not as a template to blindly apply to your system.
