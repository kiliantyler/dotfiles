The supporting cast — tools that don't fit neatly into shell, git, or terminal categories but are still managed by chezmoi.

## Atuin (Shell History)

[Atuin](https://atuin.sh/) replaces the built-in shell history with a synchronized, searchable database. My config lives at `private_dot_config/atuin/config.toml`.

- **Sync server:** Self-hosted at `atuin.thezoo.house`
- **Search mode:** Fuzzy matching
- **Secrets filter:** Enabled — commands containing tokens or passwords are excluded from sync
- **Enter behavior:** Execute on Enter, Tab to edit
- **Sync v2:** Transitive record sync enabled

Atuin is integrated in both [Fish and PowerShell](/managed-dotfiles/shell), so history follows me across platforms.

## Topgrade (System Updates)

[Topgrade](https://github.com/topgrade-rs/topgrade) runs all your package managers with a single command. Config lives at `private_dot_config/topgrade/topgrade.toml`.

- **Greedy Homebrew:** Updates casks even without version bumps
- **Auto-pulls:** The chezmoi source repo
- **Disabled:** System updates, Emacs, pnpm, containers
- Installed via mise on macOS/Linux, Scoop on Windows

## Karabiner-Elements (macOS Keyboard)

[Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) remaps keys on macOS. The config lives at `private_dot_config/karabiner/` with 13+ complex modification rules in `assets/complex_modifications/`.

This is macOS-only — the `.chezmoiignore` excludes the entire directory on other platforms.

## Editor Configuration

### Cursor / VSCode

Editor settings and keybindings are managed via chezmoi's symlink strategy. The actual files live in `.chezmoisymlinks/` so the editors can write to them directly, while chezmoi tracks the result.

- **macOS:** Cursor settings at `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/`
- **Windows:** Cursor settings at `AppData/Roaming/Cursor/User/`

Both get the same settings and keybindings through platform-conditional symlink targets.

### micro

[micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/) is a terminal text editor with custom keybindings at `private_dot_config/micro/bindings.json`. Useful when you need a quick edit and don't want to open a full editor.

## GitHub CLI

The [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) is configured at `private_dot_config/gh/config.yml` (macOS/Linux) and `AppData/Roaming/GitHub CLI/config.yml` (Windows).

- **Protocol:** HTTPS
- **Aliases:** `co` → `pr checkout`
- **Progress indicator:** Spinner style

## Claude Code

[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) configuration lives at `dot_claude/`, which becomes `~/.claude/`:

- **Settings:** Managed via symlinks (same pattern as VSCode/Cursor)
- **Skills:** Custom skills including `nano-banana` for image generation via Gemini CLI
- **Scripts:** A statusline script that formats Claude Code's JSON output into a colored terminal status bar

## Helper Scripts (`~/.bin/`)

Fifteen shell utility scripts in `dot_bin/` end up in `~/.bin/` on the PATH. They're small, focused helpers for platform detection and common checks:

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `is-macos` | Detects macOS |
| `is-arm64` | Detects ARM64 architecture |
| `is-virtual` | Detects virtual machines |
| `is-executable` | Checks if a file is executable |
| `is-file` / `is-folder` | File and folder existence |
| `is-url` | Validates URLs |
| `is-symlink` | Detects symbolic links |
| `is-true` | Boolean evaluation |
| `is-grep` | Pattern matching support check |
| `is-supported` | OS support detection |
| `am-i` | General identity helper |

These are used by other scripts and shell configurations throughout the repo.
